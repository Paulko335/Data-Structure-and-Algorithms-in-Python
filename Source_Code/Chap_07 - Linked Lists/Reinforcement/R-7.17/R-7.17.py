# R-7.17
# In the FavoritesListMTF class, we rely on public methods of the positional
# list ADT to move an element of a list at position p to become the first element
# of the list, while keeping the relative order of the remaining elements
# unchanged. Internally, that combination of operations causes one node to
# be removed and a new node to be inserted. Augment the PositionalList
# class to support a new method, move to front(p), that accomplishes this
# goal more directly, by relinking the existing node.
